        ALSET’s efforts to reach out to the NUS community as a whole, finds
        itself a new space in Residential colleges. NUS’ Residential colleges
        are unique ecosystems, with their own niche inside the vibrant NUS. To
        kick-start an exciting experience, ALSET reaches out to Tembusians at
        their home ground, over a cup of freshly brewed Fellow’s Tea.

        Prof. Y.C. Tay, one of the Residential Fellows at Tembusu Residential
        College will host the Fellow’s tea. Chris Boesch, the Deputy Director of
        Translational Research Group is enthusiastic to share more about ALSET
        and the upcoming ALSET Hackathon- ALSET for 3DM@NUS (to be held on 25
        Feb 2019). He is also looking forward to hear from Tembusians how they
        would like ALSET to influence their lives in NUS and Tembusu.

        After all the quick talk, the Fellow’s tea is to transform itself into a
        workshop aimed to encourage the students towards data-driven decision
        making. Chris and Kevin will moderate the workshop to help students
        decide their choices made at school. Students are encouraged to come up
        with prototypes of dashboards. We are looking forward to make a
        difference in education, over a cup of tea!
